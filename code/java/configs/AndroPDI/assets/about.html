<h2>AndroPDI Remote Device Controller</h2>
<p>Thank you for using the AndroPDI Remote Controller!<p>
<p>To <b>get started</b>, tap on the "Manage devices" item.</p>
<p>If you have a <b>QR code</b> for the target device, it's simplest to use the "Scan QR code" function to add the device to the list.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can <b>add devices</b> by entering their address and name, both for Bluetooth and networked (TCP/IP) devices.</p>
<p>Once you have added a device, tap it to <b>connect to the device</b>. For a Bluetooth device you will most likely need to perform pairing using a PIN (try 0000 or 1234 if in doubt). If connected, tap again to <b>show its controls</b>.</p>
