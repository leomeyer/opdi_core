This folder contains a precompiled library for OPDI slaves on Arduino Mega 2560 devices.
It is built separately from the enclosing ArduinOPDI Eclipse project because it refers to code outside of that project.

If you want to make your own OPDI slave implementation you should copy this library with it as it defines the basic configuration
specifications for your device in opdi_configspecs.h.
